## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Python 3.9+
- Git
- Supabase account
- Qdrant account
- API keys for [SambaNova](https://cloud.sambanova.ai/apis), and [Cohere](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)

### Supabase Setup

1. Once you create an account and a project, first go to the `Settings` and then the `Data API` tab. Here you'll be able to find your `Project URL`, `Anon Key` & `Service Role Key`. Copy these and paste them as explained below in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.
2. Then head to the `Table Editor` tab to create the tables to store the data.
3. Create a table called saved_mps with columns `username, mp_name, mp` as text data type and a column called `created_at` with data type as date. 
4. Create a table called saved_macros with columns `username, meal_name, food_name` as text data type, `calories, proteins, fats, carbs` as int8 data type and `date_added` as date data type.

### Qdrant Setup

1.  **Download the dataset**:
    - Go to the [download page](https://recipenlg.cs.put.poznan.pl/dataset).
    - Accept Terms and Conditions and download zip file.
    - Unpack the zip file and you'll get the `full_dataset.csv` file in the dataset directory. 
2.  **Preprocess the dataset**:
    - First run all the cells in the `dataset_preprocessing.ipynb` file found in the `misc` folder. This will allow you to get the preprocessed dataset and the dataset with 1,000,000 records.
3. **Upload the data to Qdrant**:
    - Next, run all the cells in the `upload_2_qdrant.ipynb` file located in the `misc` folder so that your vector database is ready.

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both the root directory and the `api` directory with the following variables:

#### Root `.env` (for Next.js should be created in the root directory)
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### API `.env` (for FastAPI should be created in the api folder)
```
SAMBANOVA_API_KEY=your_sambanova_api_key
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
QDRANT_URL=your_cluster_url
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key
```

### Installation Steps

Create a colder for the project
   ```bash
   cd <your folder name>
   git clone git@git.cs.bham.ac.uk:projects-2024-25/pxk232.git
